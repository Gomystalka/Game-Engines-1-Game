<h1>Game Idea Overview</h1>
<p>This'll be a bullet-hell 3D game for which the enemies and certain parts of the map will be either randomly generated, generated based off spectrum data from an audio file of choice or preset but will react to music. The surrounding landscape will also change based on the audio file provided. The player will have two modes, auto play for visualization purposes and manual mode for gameplay. The music will be freely interchangable by the player/user and most of the map will be generated as the music plays. There will be a length restriction placed on the imported audio file as to avoid both too long and too short clips.</p>

<h1>Implementation Overview</h1>
<p>The bullet-hell aspect will be implemented through the use of custom AI with certain behaviour trees reacting to specific thresholds within preset frequency bands. The overall speed and difficulty of the map will be determined by the audio file provided. UI will consist of a generic menu with an option to select an audio file. Most if not all of the landscape/world will be procedurally-generated/generated relative to the spectrum data as the game plays. There will be no pre-processing of any kind therefore the game will not support pre-made maps. There will be two modes, auto and manual. Auto mode will consist of an AI without health but still attempting to dodge/defeat enemies. This mode is for visualization purposes, therefore it will not count towards actual gameplay statistics.</p>

<h1>Required Asset Overview</h1>

 <li>Player 3D Asset (Possibly a spaceship of some kind)</li>
 <li>Weapon asset</li>
 <li>Possibly an enemy asset although enemies are planned to have procedurally-generated visuals</li>
